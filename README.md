# Starter-REST




## express-es6
Sample of express server using ES6

The goal of this project is to have a sample of server using express and the ES6 syntax
 
Details on the new technologies can be found in the 
 **Technologies** section.
 
 ## Technologies
 
 This server runs under [NodeJS v6.10.3](https://nodejs.org/en/).
 
 If you want to develop under NodeJS, please install the 
 NodeJS environment gotten from the link above. 
 
 After you installed it, please restart your computer to make the changes effective 
 (ENV_VAR, etc...).

You can use any type of database you need to work with this application.
I recommend using NoSQL databases such as MongoDB, since they store information in a format that
allows JSON conversion, and have a lot of ORM packages available through NPM.
 
 ## Intellij IDE configuration ##
 
 If you wish to make NodeJS development much easier,
 you can install several plugins into Intellij, like autocompletion,
 code highlighting, etc....
 
 To install NodeJS plugin on Intellij, follow these steps :
 
 `File > Settings > Plugins > Browse plugins repositories`
 
 Then type **NodeJS** in the search bar and press **Install**
 on the right, to install the NodeJS plugin for Intellij.
 
 You can also try out WebStorm, which is an IDE focused on web languages.
 
 All Jetbrains' IDEs are free for Polytech Students. All you have to do is 
 signing up with your student email address.

## Starting the server

Open a terminal in the root folder of the project, and type in:

```
npm install
npm start
```
